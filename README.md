In this project metadata of opendata portals was used to derive the category of open datasets. Babelfy (http://babelfy.org/) 
is used for Entity Linking, which is based on the BabelNet (https://babelnet.org/) knowledgebase.
The metadata was provided by the Open Data Portal Watch project (http://data.wu.ac.at/portalwatch/).
A GUI was developed using JavaFX to provide an interface for customization of the categorization process.
